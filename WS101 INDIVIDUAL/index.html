                <p class="p1">My full name is Karsten Cyril Bala Cruz. I am 18 years old, I was born in November 29,
                    2005. I love to explore many things, increase my knowledge and enjoy youth. I have 3 siblings and I
                    am the youngest. I'm a mama's boy. My family used to call me dragon(in filipino accent) because I
                    scream loudly and they also call me day out because when I was a baby I look like the baby in the
                    movie called baby's day out.
                </p>

                <p class="p1"> Fun fact: My papa told me that when I was 3 years old, I already know how to play a game
                    in a
                    computer,
                    even though I probably didn't really know what I was doing back then but they said I was really good
                    at it.</p>
                <p class="p1"> I have many many hobbies, playing computer games like MMORPG (those are the kinds where
                    the game is an open world). My mom used to catch me sneaking out just to play a game in a computer
                    shop that I'll eventually get scolded because I'm supposed to sleep during tanghali (noon) LOL.</p>
                <p class="p1"> I also love music, I've adopted different kinds of music through the songs my family
                    listens to. Like Rock music, Hiphop music, POP music, Rhythm and blues, Disco and many more! I don't
                    have a favourite song though cause there's alot of songs that I like.
                    I also love to dance and sing, I was really young when I started getting in to singing and dancing,
                    I used to join contests and perform as intermission for birthday parties and school events. Then
                    from birthday parties and school events, I tried to join a dance group and eventually competed on
                    some local competitions!</p>
                <p class="p1">I also mentioned that I love singing, before I started dancing I used to play with a band.
                    A band that me and my cousin formed with some friends of ours, I played the drums and sometimes
                    substitute as the vocalist. But sadly that band has come to an end because we had to part ways,
                    different paths, sad â˜¹. But now I have new band, I'm playing as the second vocalist and we're
                    preparing to join a competition called
                    battle of the bands. So here's a 5 min clip haha.</p>
